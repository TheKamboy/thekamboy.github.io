I am a teenage furry trying to be a programmer for video games.

I am a Sophomore, and I'm hoping I will be able to get out of High School without dropping out.

## My favorite programming fonts
- Cascadia Code: A pretty good ligatured font for a not so great company.
- Mononoki: The only font that I have seen that looks smooth with bad font rendering from the not so great company above.
- Honorable Mentions
    - CommitMono
    - Jetbrains Mono

## My Current Setup

I am dual booting Windows and Linux

Using GlazeWM to get tiling features so that my usage in Windows is more like Linux.
