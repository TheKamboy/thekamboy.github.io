I am a teenage furry trying to be a programmer for video games.

I am a Sophomore, and I'm hoping I will be able to get out of High School without dropping out.

## My favorite programming fonts

- Cascadia Code: A pretty good ligatured font for a not so great company.
- Mononoki: The only font that I have seen that looks smooth with bad font rendering from the not so great company above.
- Honorable Mentions
  - CommitMono
  - Jetbrains Mono

## My Current Setup

I have a HP Laptop[^1] that I use for programming, gaming, and other things.

I currently use the [EndeavourOS Linux Distro](https://endeavouros.com/) as my Operating System.
