My favorite VSCode extension is [VSpaceCode](https://vspacecode.github.io/). It is the closest thing to make VSCode more like Emacs and evil-mode.

It has Which Key, which will, show you what key to press in its menu (which you call with space while in NORMAL mode) to do a certain action.

It also has a Magit Clone, which Magit is the best keyboard based Git Manager.

VSpaceCode uses VSCodeVim[^1] as a base for Evil-Mode.

If you use VSCode, VSpaceCode will make your coding quicker.

[^1]: If you are already using VSCodeVim, you should check to make sure your keybinds don't affect VSpaceCode keybinds.
