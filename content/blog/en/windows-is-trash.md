I made the mistake of dual booting Windows, which destroyed the boot partition for Linux.
The reason was to play Windows games easier (which is a stupid thought since that is becoming easier in Linux)
It took me a bit to get a Linux USB going to repair the boot partition.

In the process of doing that, Windows died. So I had to use the family pc for making a usb.
Linux is back up and running for me, and now I say goodbye to Windows once again, hopefully for the last time.
