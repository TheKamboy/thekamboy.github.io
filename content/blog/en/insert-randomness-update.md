After a long break from making games, I'm working on games again! This was a project I was wanting to work on.

The name _Insert Randomness_ may seem stupid, **but** it's to show that the game has a lot of random things going on in it.

# What this game will include:

{{< callout emoji="ℹ️" text="This is subject to change." >}}

- A (hopefully not bad) story
- Weird Characters
- Text based graphics
- Being On All PC Platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux)
