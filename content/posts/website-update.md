You have probably noticed that the website got a **HUGE** update.

Well, I switched to using the PaperMod theme.

You can still view the old posts, as I had archived them.

The main reason to do this was so I could use `Org Mode`[^fn:1], which `ox-hugo`[^fn:2] uses PaperMod[^fn:3] as a template for it. PaperMod[^fn:3] looks _way_ nicer than the theme I used before.

Since I currently am using the Tokyo Night[^fn:4] theme, I might update the CSS of the website to have the Tokyo Night[^fn:4] theme as the website theme.

Hopefully this new style for the website makes it look more modern, instead of looking like a website from the 2000s.
