[{"content":"Introduction to Emacs GNU Emacs is an open source, customizable graphical text editor with different modes1. GNU Emacs is usually just called Emacs, which is what I will call it from now on.\nOrgins It was originally a Terminal application, but it was different than other text editors from the time since it had a User Interface.\nDifferences Some people may think that Emacs is a graphical clone of Vim, but that\u0026rsquo;s actually a plugin that makes it more like Vim (more on that later). Standard Emacs is more like VSCode in terms of controlling, but it came way before VSCode. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a Normal mode or Insert mode, it\u0026rsquo;s just like VSCode where when you type it puts it in the file. There are still keybinds though. If you press Alt+x (referred to as M-x, M means Meta). It opens up a command prompt similar to Vim\u0026rsquo;s Command Mode.\nChurch and Cult Remember how earlier in this post there is a Vim plugin for Emacs? Its name is evil-mode. Because of the name usually people who use the standard Emacs keybinds are in the church of Emacs, while people who use Vim Keybinds are in the cult of Vim. Don\u0026rsquo;t get scared and stick to using Emacs keybinds when you are used to Vim keybinds. It\u0026rsquo;s just a silly thing that Emacs users do.\nDoom Emacs Doom Emacs is a config for Emacs.\nAn Emacs framework for the stubborn martian hacker.\nthe Doom Emacs description on it\u0026rsquo;s code page It\u0026rsquo;s designed to be fast and as close to base Emacs as possible. It also has a Command Line Interface doom. Doom Emacs is designed for Linux and Mac, but it can be used with Windows (I\u0026rsquo;ve tried it before, but I don\u0026rsquo;t recommend. If you want to use it with Windows, use it in a Linux virtual machine, like Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s WSL.).\nDefaults and Package Management Doom Emacs defaults to using evil-mode, so it\u0026rsquo;s Vim user friendly. Doom Emacs has a init.el file in its config for packages that have code in Doom Emacs that supports it. If you can\u0026rsquo;t find a package you want to use in that file, you can install it in the packages.el file.\nInit File There are multiple sections of the init file. You can uncomment lines to activate them. Make sure to save before reloading your config. You can learn more about a package by pressing K if you are using evil-mode or Control+C+c+k if you use the standard Emacs keybinds (Control+C will NOT close your editor, unlike other apps where Control+C will). If you want to add a Module Flag to the package, first surround it with parentheses (ex. (package)), then add the module flag (ex. (package +flag)).\n:input\nThis section allows you to setup things relating to your keyboard to make using Doom Emacs easier if you are not using America\u0026rsquo;s QWERTY layout.\n:completion\nFor a normal user, you do not need to change things (unless you want to add some +icons to vertico). If you do want to change your completions, go ahead.\n:ui\nThis changes the User Interface of Doom Emacs, or adds new User Interfaces to it. It can also add features like for example, deft. It is known as a Major Mode, and it is meant for creating, browsing, and filtering notes. You can also add some tabs to it.\n:editor\nThis allows you to add more features to the text editor part of Emacs. If you want to have multiple cursors like you can have in VSCode, uncomment multiple-cursors.\n:emacs\nThis makes built-in Emacs features nicer. Not much for this.\n:term\nThis makes it so you can have a terminal in Emacs. I (and many others including the config) recommend you use vterm.\nthe best terminal emulation in Emacs\nDoom Emacs comment in its config :checkers\nThese are for checking your code mistakes, and/or your grammar mistakes, and/or your spelling mistakes. syntax is not needed for error detection (another plugin does it), but it\u0026rsquo;s recommended for error highlighting for easier error spotting without using the search tool a lot.\n:tools\nThis section is really important if you are looking to code in Doom Emacs.\nlsp is for showing errors, and other cool actions like if you were using VSCode. tree-sitter This isn\u0026rsquo;t required, but if you want actually good syntax highlighting, uncomment this. The issue with both is that if you want to use them, you have to enable it for each language you want to use them on. More on that in the :lang section.\nIf you use git, you should enable magit, it\u0026rsquo;s a great git manager for Emacs.\n:os\nThis is for supporting other ways of using Emacs.\nmacos is to enable more support for MacOS. You shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have to enable it since it does it automatically. tty is for better terminal support, if you don\u0026rsquo;t have a Desktop Enviroment or Window Manager, or if you like using Emacs like it was like the early days. :lang\nThis section is for enabling programming language support.\nMost of them should support these two options:\nLanguage Servers +lsp, requires lsp to be enabled in :tools. Better Syntax Highlighting +tree-sitter, requires tree-sitter to be enabled in :tools. :email\nIf you want to use Emacs as an Email Client, you can enable one of these. I don\u0026rsquo;t use them so I don\u0026rsquo;t have anything to say about them.\n:app\nThere are some apps for Emacs. You can enable some here.\n:config\nThere are two options for your config.\nliterate uses Org Mode for turning your config into documentation. default is for Doom Emacs defaults. If you are not a Pro User, leave it alone. Config File The config file is for configuring variables, packages, and Doom Emacs.\nBasically plugins that do different things with Emacs.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/doom-emacs-is-cool/","summary":"Introduction to Emacs GNU Emacs is an open source, customizable graphical text editor with different modes1.
