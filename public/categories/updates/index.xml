      <description>You have probably noticed that the website got a HUGE update.
Well, I switched to using the PaperMod theme.
You can still view the old posts, as I had archived them.
The main reason to do this was so I could use Org Mode1, which ox-hugo2 uses PaperMod3 as a template for it. PaperMod3 looks way nicer than the theme I used before.
Since I currently am using the Tokyo Night4 theme, I might update the CSS of the website to have the Tokyo Night4 theme as the website theme.</description>

      <description>After a long break from making games, I&amp;rsquo;m working on games again! This was a project I was wanting to work on.
The name Insert Randomness may seem stupid, but it&amp;rsquo;s to show that the game has a lot of random things going on in it.
What this game will include: ℹ️ This is subject to change. A (hopefully not bad) story Weird Characters Text based graphics Being On All PC Platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux) Here is a link to the GitHub Page, but it&amp;rsquo;s in it&amp;rsquo;s early stages.</description>
