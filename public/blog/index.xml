      <description>ðŸ›ˆ This is not an ad. I just like this extension. My favorite VSCode extension is VSpaceCode. It is the closest thing to make VSCode more like Emacs and evil-mode.
It has Which Key, which will, show you what key to press in its menu (which you call with space while in NORMAL mode) to do a certain action.
It also has a Magit Clone, which Magit is the best keyboard based Git Manager.</description>

      <description>After a long break from making games, I&amp;rsquo;m working on games again! This was a project I was wanting to work on.
The name Insert Randomness may seem stupid, but it&amp;rsquo;s to show that the game has a lot of random things going on in it.
What this game will include: ðŸ›ˆ This is subject to change. A (hopefully not bad) story Weird Characters Text based graphics Being On All PC Platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux) Here is a link to the GitHub Page, but it&amp;rsquo;s in it&amp;rsquo;s early stages.</description>

      <description>I made the mistake of dual booting Windows, which destroyed the boot partition for Linux. The reason was to play Windows games easier (which is a stupid thought since that is becoming easier in Linux) It took me a bit to get a Linux USB going to repair the boot partition.
In the process of doing that, Windows died. So I had to use the family pc for making a usb.</description>
