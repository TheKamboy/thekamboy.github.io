      <description>I made the mistake of dual booting Windows, which destroyed the boot partition for Linux. The reason was to play Windows games easier (which is a stupid thought since that is becoming easier in Linux) It took me a bit to get a Linux USB going to repair the boot partition.
In the process of doing that, Windows died. So I had to use the family pc for making a usb.</description>
