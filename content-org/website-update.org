You have probably noticed that the website got a *HUGE* update.

Well, I switched to using the PaperMod theme.

You can still view the old posts, as I had archived them.

The main reason to do this was so I could use =Org Mode=[fn:1:[[https://orgmode.org/]]], which =ox-hugo=[fn:2:[[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/]]] uses PaperMod[fn:3:[[https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/]]] as a template for it. PaperMod[fn:3] looks /way/ nicer than the theme I used before.

Since I currently am using the Tokyo Night[fn:4:[[https://github.com/tokyo-night/tokyo-night-vscode-theme]]] theme, I might update the CSS of the website to have the Tokyo Night[fn:4] theme as the website theme.

Hopefully this new style for the website makes it look more modern, instead of looking like a website from the 2000s.
